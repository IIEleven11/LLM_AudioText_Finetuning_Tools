# LLM_AudioText_Finetuning_Tools

I went ahead and commented some of them as I didnt expect anyone to be using these but me they were poorly explained. Hopefully the comments help

This is a place too put all the scripts and tools I make for fine tuning large language models and the aquisition and or curation of the datasets.

- The "audio and voice tools" folder has my dataset curation scripts. I use these at various points in the fine tuning process.
